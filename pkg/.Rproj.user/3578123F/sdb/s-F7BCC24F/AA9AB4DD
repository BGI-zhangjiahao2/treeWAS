best?\n\n\\item \\textbf{parameters:}\n  \\begin {itemize}\n  \\item p-value: 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001.\n  \\item p-value correction: bonferroni, false discovery rate.\n  \\item p-value distribution

(i.e., measures of association) performs the best? Under what conditions?\n\\item What level of performance do we achieve \\textit{across all three scores} (e.g., ``Did \\textit{at least one} score find all of the simulated associated SNPs?'')\n\\end {itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Score 3:}\n\\begin {itemize}\n\\item Which of the potential implementations of Score 3 (the ``Subsequent Score'') performs the best? Under what conditions?\n\\item What limitations remain in Score 3?\n\\item Which sets of conditions are not adequately accounted for by the other two scores?\n\\item What improvements could be made to Score 3 that would allow it to dominate the other two scores under certain sets of conditions?\n\\end {itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{SNP and Phenotype Simulation with Transition Rate Matrix Q:}\n\\begin {itemize}\n\\item Is Q the best way to simulate associations between SNPs and a phenotype?\n\\item What parameters (s, af) should be used?\n\\item How should we account for varying (total) branch lengths (e.g., between coalescent- and rtrees)?\n\\item Can we identify a general formula to predict the expected number of substitutions to appear on a tree (in the simulated phenotype and associated SNPs), for a given tree and set of parameters (s, af), with the states of the phenotype and the SNPs being drawn at random and independently at the root of the tree?\n\\end {itemize}\n\n\\end

components:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item A \\textbf{phylogenetic tree} describing the genetic relationship between individuals in the simulated dataset.\n\\item A \\textbf{phenotype} for each individual to be used in defining the ``cases'' and ``controls'' whose genetic basis we wish to distinguish by using GWAS methods.\n\\item A \\textbf{SNP matrix} for each individual, in accordance with the phylogenetic tree, which may contain some SNPs associated with the phenotype.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\noindent\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsection{Simulation Sets}
