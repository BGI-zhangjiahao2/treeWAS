Moreover, \\textit{treeWAS} attempts to distinguish \\textit{true} signals of association from a noisy background of ``chance'' associations. Because, in microbial organisms, individual isolates descend clonally from a common ancestor, population structure can have a substantial confounding effect on association studies.\n\n~\\\\The degree to which population structure is present in a sample is defined by how extensively allele frequencies differ systematically between its subpopulations. Problematic population stratification arises when these subpopulation clusters overlap with the phenotypic grouping of individuals under study. If genetic relatedness is unaccounted for, or accounted for insufficiently, when attempting to identify associations between genotype and phenotype, it is likely that the loci underpinning population structure will be incorrectly inferred to be directly associated with the phenotype instead. The risk of identifying false positive findings increases with the degree of clonality and linkage disequilibrium (or lack of recombination and mutation), as well as the extent of phenotypic clustering and the overlap between phenotypic and subpopulation groups.\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Cluster-Based versus Phylogenetic Approaches} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n~\\\\The central task of \\textit{treeWAS} is to disentangle genuine associations between genotype and phenotype from confounding genetic relatedness. While the scope of relatedness in clonal organisms presents a particular challenge to association studies, clonality also enables the adoption of a phylogenetic solution. Phylogenetic trees allow for the detailed identification of genetic relationships, not only at the level of population clusters, but at the resolution of subpopulation lineages and individual links. Where traditional approaches to population stratification (such as PCA) operate at the level of broad population clusters, \\textit{treeWAS} adopts a phylogenetic approach to capture population structure in high definition.\n\n~\\\\Cluster-based approaches to the problem of population stratification necessarily delineate between ``population structure effects'' and ``associations'' at the level of the cluster. Any signal that exists \\textit{within} population clusters (in a stratified design), or that persists after the genetic data has been \\textit{corrected} for the differences between clusters (in a PCA-based approach), is deemed to be a ``true'' association. Methods operating on clusters attempt to optimise this delineation, for example, by choosing the ``best'' \\textit{k} with k-means. In reality, however, no ``true'' \\textit{k} exists, and these methods can fall pray to errors of both over- and under-correction. If too few clusters are used, the effects of population stratification will remain a confounding factor; and yet, when the number of clusters is increased, over-correction can result in a loss of signal and failure to detect associations of any strength.\n\n~\\\\By adopting a phylogenetic approach, \\textit{treeWAS} is able to circumvent this problem. The phylogenetic tree can be used to map out the population structure in full. In lieu of identifying clusters by drawing an artifical boundary at a given height on the tree, \\textit{treeWAS} takes a number of additional steps to delineate true associations from associations due to population stratification. The phylogenetic tree is used to guide the simulation of ``null'' genetic data. This null data mirrors the data under analysis in genetic relatedness, but has no relationship to the phenotype beyond that attributed to the structure of the tree and the clustering of the phenotype along its tips. The association between genotype and phenotype is measured, at all loci, in both the real dataset and the null dataset. The distribution of scores achieved by loci in the null dataset is used to identify a threshold of significance (in its upper tail); and, finally, any loci in the real dataset achieving scores above this threshold are identified as statistically significant associations. In this way, \\textit{treeWAS} is able to identify associations without ever having to reduce the detailed phylogenetic information into a coarser cluster-based representation.\n\n%% SPIN THIS MORE POSITIVELY?--ie w cluster-based soln you could increase K until you account for more and more of the pop str,\n%% but there is no innate means by which to determine where to draw the line with a cluster-based soln.\n%% Because there IS no objective, consistent line between ``population structure'' and ``non-structure''.\n%% Over-correction (too many K) can easily occur if the inclusion of another PC (or K (??)) comprises the dimension of variation that\n%% contains the main phenotypic variation!\n%% With treeWAS, we have an objective means by which to determine where to draw the line between the noise of background population structure and\n%% true signals of association that arise beyond this structure.\n\n%% Could show a nice plot side-by-side plot with tree and main PCs and K clusters --> draw line at level of structure (tree height) accounte for and\n%% colour clades to match K.

However, we will perform a more thorough comparative analysis and determine whether or not both methods have merit. It is possible that we may want to exclude the maximum likelihood option if it provides no added value.}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Identification of homoplasy distribution:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item During the ancestral character estimation procedure performed by parsimony in step (2), a site-specific substitution rate is inferred according to the Fitch algorithm. Taken together, these rates compose the homoplasy distribution.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Simulation of null genetic data:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The simulation of a set of ``null'' genetic data is guided by three parameters that are taken from the empirical dataset: (i) the phylogenetic tree, (ii) the homoplasy distribution, and (iii) the number of genetic variables to be simulated.\n\\item The simulation begins by drawing N binary genetic variables at random for the root node (where N = 10x the number of loci in the empirical dataset), and proceeds under a fully-linked clonal model of evolution. The simulated loci undergo substitutions at rates defined by the homoplasy distribution, on branches drawn at random with probabilities proportional to relative branch length.\n\\item The simulated dataset that results will resemble the empirical dataset in both population stratification and genetic composition, but it will \\textit{not} recreate the statistical associations between genotype and phenotype in the empirical dataset (excluding the desired ``chance'' associations due to population stratification and genetic composition). Note that, while we simulate null genetic data, the phenotype is maintained in its original distribution across the tips of the tree.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Ancestral character estimation (on null data):}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Step (2) is repeated; this time, in application to the simulated null genetic dataset.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Statistical tests of association:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item First, loci in the simulated data are tested for association to the empirical phenotype. This allows for the identification of a null distribution of association scores; that is, the distribution of association score values expected under the null hypothesis of ``no association''. The null distribution contains the set of association scores that arise due to chance (including due to population stratification).\n\\item Second, association tests are applied to the empirical data to identify the distribution of statistical associations observed in the sample.\n\\item A panel of three different tests of association is applied to all loci in both the empirical and null datasets. These tests are described in greater detail in the following section. The three tests -- (i) the Terminal Score, (ii) the Synchronous Score, (iii) the Asynchronous Score -- are performed together because each provides a different insight into the nature of associations observed in the dataset. Associations identified in more than one of the three sets of results are likely to be the strongest associations; however, substantial overlap between the three sets of results is not necessarily expected. Significant associations may arise in only one of the three sets. It is recommended that users guide their interpretation of the specific nature of these associations with reference to the following section on association testing (a condensed version of which will be provided within the treeWAS documentation).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Identification of threshold of significance and associations:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The null distribution obtained in step (6) is used to identify the threshold of statistical significance. This is determined according to a base p-value (e.g., 0.01) that indicates what percentage of the values in the null distribution should exceed the threshold (e.g., 1\\%). It is inferred that any empirical association score value that exceed this threshold has only a [p-value]\\% (e.g., 1\\%) chance of occurring under the null hypothesis of ``no association'' (i.e., of being false positive findings).\n\\item Among the set of association scores from tests applied to the empirical dataset, values that exceed this threshold are deemed to be statistically significant associations, and thus candidates for true biological association, pending subsequent confirmatory analyses.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsection{Tests of Association} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsubsection{Score 1}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsubsection{Score 2}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsubsection{Score 3}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\color{red}\nNote on score 3: All tests shown below are using the modified version of our integral-based score 3 which does \\textit{not} take branch length into account.

At each genetic locus, the test measures association to the phenotype in question and returns a result consisting of a classification for this locus (``associated'' or ``non-associated'') and a measure of significance (for example, a p-value).\n\n~\\\\To achieve a balanced appraisal of the performance of classifiers, one must consider both their ``precision'' and ``recall''. Recall refers to the ability of a classifier to identify its target (i.e., the set of associated loci, for an association test). Precision refers to the ability of the classifier to rule out everything else (i.e., the non-associated loci). Neither precision nor recall can be measured on empirical data in which the true state of each data point is unknown. Simulated data, however, can be used to evaluate and calibrate the performance of associated tests.\n\n~\\\\The most common measure of recall is sensitivity. In this simulation study, sensitivity can be measured for all association tests. In theory, sensitivity can take on any value between zero and one, inclusive. In this study, however, sensitivity can only obtain ten unique values (0.0, 0.1, ..., 0.9, 1.0) because only ten of the 10,000 simulated loci have been generated in association to the phenotype. A value of 1.0 denotes perfect sensitivity, and would indicate that 10/10 of the associated loci were detected. A value of 0.9 would indicate that 9/10 were detected, and so on, down to the worst score of 0.0, indicating failure to detect any of the associated loci.\n\n\n~\\\\To measure precision, we focus on the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), as opposed to specificity (or its complement, the False Positive Rate (FPR)), for reasons discussed below.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Why use PPV?}  %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is one of the most useful measures of precision from the perspective of the \\textit{user}. For the user of an association test, PPV answers an important question: ``What proportion of the `significant' findings are \\textit{truly} associated?''. PPV ranges between zero and one, inclusive, corresponding to the worst and perfect precision, respectively.\n\n~\\\\PPV is particularly valuable when classifiers are applied to datasets with significant class imbalances. Our simulation study, like most association studies, is one such case: the ratio of truly associated loci to non-associated loci is quite small. In our study, only 0.1\\% of the data (10/10,000 loci) is truly associated with the phenotype. In the face of such a class imbalance, FPR is far less informative than PPV. A numerically ``low'' FPR value can correspond to an unacceptably high number of false positives.\n\n~\\\\Suppose, for example, that an association test applied to a dataset from our simulation study correctly classified all 10/10 truly associated loci but also mis-classified 500 truly non-associated loci as ``significant''. This test would have a perfect sensitivity of 1.0. It would also have an apparently low FPR of only 0.05. In theory, these measures suggest very good performance. In practice, combing through 510 candidate loci in the laboratory when only 10 of these are truly associated with the phenotype will be prohibitively inefficient.\n\n~\\\\By contrast, if we measure sensitivity and \\textit{PPV} for this dataset, we can offset the perfect sensitivity of 0.1 with a very low PPV value of 0.02. Given that we know that only 2\\% of our `significant' findings are truly associated, we know immediately that this is a poor test of association.\n\n~\\\\There is an intuitive relationship between PPV and performance that does not hold true for FPR when the substantial class imbalances expected in genetic association studies are taken into consideration.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Why use the F1 Score?}  %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%\nBecause both precision and recall must be taken into consideration when evaluating the performance of association tests, it is useful to identify a composite measure that can enable the simultaneous consideration of both aspects of performance.\n\n~\\\\Again, owing to the substantial class imbalances between the number of associated and non-associated loci, ``accuracy'' will provide a poor measure of performance because the number of true negatives will always be very large, relative to the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives.\n\n%% NOTE: the F1 score is the harmonic mean of PPV and sensitivity.\n\n% Why the harmonic mean instead of the arithmetic and geometric?\n% Arithmetic is best when we have things that it makes sense to sum.\n%\n% Geometric is best when we are multiplying, for example, calculating the true interest rate over time.\n%\n% And harmonic is best when we’re dealing with rates and ratios. Since precision and recall are ratios, it’s the most appropriate.\n%\n% The F1 score weighs precision and recall equally. Though alternative weighting schemes exist, we choose to value precision and recall equally in this analysis.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Practical Note:}  %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%         %%%%%%%%%\nIf, during any test, no loci were detected as significant, F1 score = 0/0 = NaN. To represent these values in the boxplots, I replaced them with zeros in the data to be plotted.

Each simulation set below will be presented under four different parameters for the background homoplasy distribution: Poisson(1), R = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 (i.e., Poisson distribution with parameter 1, and recombination rates of 0\\%, 0.01\\%, 0.05\\%, 1\\%).\n\n~\\\\I had predicted that the sensitivity values (at least the median values in the boxplots) for our three tests would show a general decreasing trend as the SimBac R value in the background homoplasy distribution was increased. The result did not entirely match my predictions: median sensitivity for set 1 terminal scores were 1 for R = 0, 0 for R = 0.05, and 0.5 for R = 0.1. This extreme fluctuation may be due to the above hit-or-miss problem for the terminal score discussed below. Though I notice the sensitivity trend as a function of R was also not ``in order'', but instead was R=0 > > R=0.01 > R=0.1 > R=0.05. I'm not sure if this deviation from the expected trend is abnormal, or outside what might be within reasonable variation with 20 rounds of simulations and tests run at each level of recombination.\n\n~\\\\As one level of sanity check, I can say that the homoplasy distributions that were returned from ClonalFrame ML run on the SimBac output look like they make sense and follow a trend:\n\n%% include simBac dists in plot for and data form, and send Xavier input data to check...\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n  \\caption{\\textbf{Number of substititions (SimBac by amount of

the terminal score for set 1 below.\n\n~\\\\To recall, in set 1, associations between SNP and phenotype are made by creating perfect associations across the tree (i.e., if the phenotype undergoes 15 substitutions, the SNP undergoes the same 15) and then 10\\% of the SNPs are switched to the alternate state at the terminal nodes of the tree. The result of this is that the associated SNPs in simulation set 1 all have very similar terminal scores of approximately 0.8.\n\n~\\\\It follows that the 10 associated SNPs are usually either all above or below the threshold selected in the terminal test. Whether these are above or below the threshold depends primarily on the shape of the null distribution and not on the scores for the associated SNPs, as the latter vary little. The main feature that drives the shape of the null distribution, all other parameters being equal, is the degree to which the phenotype is clustered on the leaves of the tree.\n\n\\clearpage\n~\\\\We can compare two rounds of simulations from set 1 which have been simulated with a background homoplasy distribution drawn from the SimBac dataset with R = 0.01.\n\n~\\\\In the first example, we see extensive clustering of the phenotype into a small number of large blocks.\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]%{0.45\\textwidth}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Moderately-clustered phenotype on coalescent tree (set 1)}}\n    \\label{fig: Moderately-clustered phenotype on coalescent tree (set 1)}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth, height=8cm]{figs/{set1_28_tree_plot}}\n\\end{figure}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n~\\\\Here, none of the associated SNPs are above the threshold of significance because many of the background SNPs have achieved high terminal scores.\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]%{0.45\\textwidth}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Terminal score results with moderately-clustered phenotype (set 1)}}\n    \\label{fig: Terminal score results with moderately-clustered phenotype (set 1)}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth, height=8cm]{figs/{set1_28_plot_terminal}}\n\\end{figure}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\n~\\\\By contrast, in this example we see that the phenotype clusters into smaller and more fragmented blocks along the tips of the tree.\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]%{0.45\\textwidth}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Highly-clustered phenotype on coalescent tree (set 1)}}\n    \\label{fig: Highly-clustered phenotype on coalescent tree (set 1)}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth, height=8cm]{figs/{set1_27_tree_plot}}\n\\end{figure}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n~\\\\And, as a result, all of the associated SNPs are above the threshold of significance because fewer of the background SNPs have achieved high terminal scores.\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]%{0.45\\textwidth}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Terminal score results with highly-clustered phenotype (set 1)}}\n    \\label{fig: Terminal score results with highly-clustered phenotype (set 1)}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth, height=8cm]{figs/{set1_27_plot_terminal}}\n\\end{figure}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\n~\\\\I have brought up the discussion above because the pattern is quite stark in the sensitivity values in the beeswarm-and-box plots below for the terminal score (i.e., the beeswarm plot values tend to be either 0 or 1 for sensitivity).

\\newpage\n\\clearpage\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsection{Performance of score 3 (``subsequent test'') and alternatives}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\\color{red}\nTBD: Note that this has NOT been updated since the last time you saw it. I am only running the first and seventh score 3 versions listed below in the tests that I am running now, as well as a new version of our integral score (the seventh below) that does not take branch length into account when calculating the score. This latter score, the integral-without-branch length, is the score 3 being shown in all boxplots above.\n\n\\color{black}\n\n\n\n\n~\\\\Given the unremarkable performance of the third test of association in \\textit{treeWAS} (our ``subsequent score''), it appears that we may need to either idenitfy a more successful alternative implementation of Score 3, or determine whether there may not be any gaps that must (or, indeed, \\textit{can}) be filled by a third score.\n\n~\\\\We should continue to strive to identify any circumstances wherein Scores 1 and 2 simultaneously under-perform, but in which it is conceivable that an alternative third score might be able to capture associations by other means.\n\n~\\\\Thus far I have attempted to implement a number of potential Score 3 variants. I'm afraid I will have to explain these properly later, but in a few sentences: Score3 1:5 are all based on what is essentially an \\textit{output} Q matrix whose cells contain a record of the number of instances of each configuration of (SNPi.ancestor, Pheni,ancestor | SNPi.descendant, Pheni.descendant) across all edges in a tree. Edge-weighted versions of these scores simply edge-weight this tally proportional to branch length. The Score 3 variants then combine this information in a given way.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n%% Q-based:\n\\item \\textbf{Score3.1} Simple ``tally'' score, no weights. \\textit{max(sum(Q.assoc), sum(Q.non.assoc)), where: assoc = 00|11, non.assoc = 01|01, eg.}\n\\item \\textbf{Score3.2} Complex ``tally'' score, weighted (but NOT edge-weighted!): multiply tallies in table cells s.t. simultaneous cells (x3), maintained cells (x2), subsequent cells (x1). (And, yes, I realise these score weights may seem backwards for a supposedly ``subsequent'' score. But I've tried, for example, the reverse scoring weights and this neither works nor makes a great deal of sense.) \\textit{max(sum(Q.assoc*score.weights), sum(Q.non.assoc*score.weights)), where: assoc = 00|11, non.assoc = 01|01, eg.}\n\\item \\textbf{Score3.3} Edge-weighted Score3.1.\n\\item \\textbf{Score3.4} Edge-weighted Score3.2. \\textit{\\textbf{max}(pos, neg).}\n\\item \\textbf{Score3.5} Edge-weighted Score3.2. \\textit{\\textbf{abs}(pos - neg).}\n\n%% Integral-based:\n\\item \\textbf{Score3.6} Original integral-based Score 3. \\textit{\\textbf{abs}(pos - neg).}\n\\item \\textbf{Score3.7} Original integral-based Score 3. \\textit{\\textbf{max}(pos, neg).}\n\n%% Simple Score 1 (i.e., Terminal Score) - like Score 3, calculated across edges:\n\\item \\textbf{Score3.8} Terminal.score-like Score 3 (i.e., Score 1, across edges). \\textit{\\textbf{abs}(pos - neg).}\n\\item \\textbf{Score3.9} Terminal.score-like Score 3 (i.e., Score 1, across edges). \\textit{\\textbf{max}(pos, neg).}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n~\\\\Their performance is illustrated below.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n  \\caption{\\textbf{Performance by score 3 method (set 3, tree=coal, s=10, af=5)}}\n  \\label{fig:Performance by score 3 method (set 3, tree=coal, s=10, af=5)}\n    \\centering\n    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n    \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\\textwidth}\n        \\caption{\\textbf{FPR}}\n        \\label{fig: FPR by score 3 method (set 3, tree=coal, s=10, af=5)}\n        \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth, height=3cm]{figs/{set3_31_40_coal_s_10_af_5_score3_tests_FPR}}\n    \\end{subfigure}\n    ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \\quad, \\qquad, \\hfill etc.\n      %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)\n    \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\\textwidth}\n        \\caption{\\textbf{sensitivity}}\n        \\label{fig: sensitivity by score 3 method (set 3, tree=coal, s=10, af=5)}\n        \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth, height=3cm]{figs/{set3_31_40_coal_s_10_af_5_score3_tests_sensitivity}}\n    \\end{subfigure}\n    ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \\quad, \\qquad, \\hfill etc.\n    %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)\n    \\quad\n    \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\\textwidth}\n        \\caption{\\textbf{PPV}}\n        \\label{fig: PPV by score 3 method (set 3, tree=coal, s=10, af=5)}\n        \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth, height=3cm]{figs/{set3_31_40_coal_s_10_af_5_score3_tests_PPV}}\n    \\end{subfigure}\n        ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \\quad, \\qquad, \\hfill etc.\n    %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)\n    \\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\\textwidth}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{F1.score}}\n        \\label{fig: F1.score by score 3 method (set 3, tree=coal, s=10, af=5)}\n        \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth, height=3cm]{figs/{set3_31_40_coal_s_10_af_5_score3_tests_F1score}}\n    \\end{subfigure}\n    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\chapter{Appendix}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% **** THE END!!! **** %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\newpage\n%% \\bibliographystyle{plain}\n%% \\bibliography{biblioTJ}\n\n\\end{document}\n\n",
